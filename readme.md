# 1BTC PUZZLE : 37XTVuaWt1zyUPRgDDpsnoo5ioHk2Da6Fs

"This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto's famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry. The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life, and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work."

# CLUES

## You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture

- Outside / inside circle
- BIP39 / not BIP39
- only a certain font size

## Think in pairs

- ???
- we must find pairs of words...
- public/private key ?

## Code easily, attack early

- might be first 4 valid BIP39 words
- might be 4 valid BIP39 words i the seed
- could be a clue to tell us : code is easy, start asap
- is an example of "Think in pairs"

## Lost transaction costs *almost* users

Followed a reference to the serie of numbers in Lost

- ???

## 00212121

- is the amount in btc of a tx linked to the original address (2607c7ae1078643506a6580295849f6289f944e6f8156d1fbacdb4e162fca808)
- could be a password
- could be the derivation path : m/49'/0'/21'/21/21
- means "null!!!" in hex (to be checked)

## Try +1

- add 1 to some fields in derivation path
- add a word ?

## Almost open

- are 2 valid BIP39 words (small font size & in circle)


## Bonus clue: To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot.

- find the password ?
- what is home?

## -1

- remove one of the previous steps
- undo +1
- probably same seed & derivation path but without password

# Unvalid BIP39 combinations from clues words (but working in iancoleman)

- code easily attack
- easily attack early
- code easily attack early almost open

12 words is the minimum (in BIP39)
